# STA457-Final-Project
Final Project for STA457: Time Series Analysis

This is the space for all the code submissions for the Final Project of STA457H1 S Time Series Analysis, for LEC0201.
Rmd and ipynb files can be found in the repository, containing code snippets we used for preprocessing, visualizing, and modeling the data for this project.

STA457_Preprocessing_Submission.Rmd contains the data preprocessing process as well as some visualizations for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
\newline
STA457_ARIMA_Submission.Rmd contains some EDA snippets, and is the main space for diagnosing the original time series as well as implemetation and tests of the ARIMA model.
\newline
STA457_ARCH_Submission.Rmd contains ARCH/GARCH implementations and testing.
\newline
STA457_Multivariate_Submission.Rmd contains ARIMAX implementations and testing.
\newline
STA457_LSTM_Submission.Rmd contains LSTM implementations and testing.
